<h2>Pokedex</h2>
It's a JavaScript frontend application which help you get some information about pokemons. 
I was inspired to take part in the competition organised by Kottans. Thanks them for this opportunity.<br> 
It's a realisation of first test task.<br>
For easy viewing there are not more than 12 thumbnails on the screen at the same time.
You are able to filter pokemon thumbnails by one or two types. Also I tried to implement
Ð°daptive desing.

You can run this application via this link: http://cidre.github.io
